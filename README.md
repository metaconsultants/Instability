# Instabilities
This repo contains files that can be used to under various instability problems in mechanics at hands. Wrinkling is the phenomena associated due to compression of an elastic solid. <br />

As Euler reported long back when an elastic solid is compressed, after reaching a critical load value it buckles. Our studies here exten
Here we are adding a summary of buckling that is simulated by us in <code> Abaqus </code>.  First two cases illustrate the application in biomechanics keeping elastic / hyperelastic materials in mind.

The motivation behind such numerical models lie to  quantify the amount and nature of wrinkling and buckling in materials that could form the basis of the modeling e.g. flexible electronics, designing skin related actuators. <br />
