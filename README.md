# Instability
This repo contains files that can be used to under various instability problems in mechanics at hands. Wrinkling is the phenomena associated due to compression of an elastic solid. <br />

As Euler reported long back when an elastic solid is compressed, after reaching a critical value it buckles. Here we are adding a summary of buckling that is simulated by us in <code> Abaqus <code/> .
